# AMXX New Year Plugins 2023

### Usage
To use plugins on a Non-ReHLDS server, it is enough to comment ```#include <reapi>``` like this:

```Pawn
// #include <reapi>
```

### API: Player Weapon Model
The plugin allows you to create an additional entity for p_ weapon models, specifying animation, body, skin. Basically, you can use this plugin in order to save resources on p_ weapon models

### Extra-Item: SG552 Cerberus
The SG552 Cerberus weapon from the Counter-Strike Online game is based on normal code, which is most similar to the original weapon from the game. After watching the video, plugins with these weapons from other authors, I saw terrible code, and also the wrong physics of weapons, so I decided to make my own version, which will be completely (or almost completely) similar to the original weapons from the game

- ```_fx``` sprites will be loaded if you use the UseOptimizedSprites setting in the plugin (Other sprites will not be uploaded to the client)
